App for tracking weights and assist with sets tempo.

This app allows you to save and update the weights for every gym device you use so you won't forget what was the weight last
time you were in the gym.
Plus, there is kind of metronome that play sounds every second in order to assist you do the sets according to the right tempo.

My first application to get familiar with android development.
